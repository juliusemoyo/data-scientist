# 🎓 Institution Device Management System

This is a Python-based system to **register and track devices** (like laptops, phones, tablets) belonging to students and staff in an institution. It uses **SQLite** for storage and allows reporting & tracking of stolen devices.

---

## 📦 Features

* Register **students**, **staff**, and their **devices**
* Check if a device is **registered or reported stolen**
* Automatically remove **graduated students**
* Log device activity (Wi-Fi + timestamp)
* Track stolen devices and view their activity log
* View or remove any device

---

## 🧠 How the Code Works (Detailed Breakdown)

### 🔹 1. **Database Initialization**

The script initializes an SQLite database `institution_db.sqlite` with 4 tables:

* `students`
* `staff`
* `registered_devices`
* `device_activity_log`

Each table has unique constraints for tracking and relationships.

### 🔹 2. **Utility Functions**

* `get_serial_and_model()`
  Gets system serial/model (on Windows/Linux)

* `get_connected_wifi()`
  Reads the current Wi-Fi SSID (for activity logging)

* `auto_remove_graduates()`
  Automatically deletes students whose `graduation_year` < current year

* `check_stolen_device(serial)`
  Checks if a device is flagged as stolen

## 📋 Main Functionalities (Mapped to Menu Options)

### 1️⃣ **Register a Student**

Prompts for:

* Admission Number
* Name
* Course
* Graduation Year
* Phone Number

Adds the student to the `students` table.

---

### 2️⃣ **Register Staff**

Prompts for:

* Name
* Department
* Phone Number

Adds staff to the `staff` table.

---

### 3️⃣ **Register Device**

* Detects device info (for laptops) or prompts manually
* Links device to either a student or staff using their ID
* Stores it in `registered_devices`

🚨 If the device is already marked as **stolen**, registration is blocked.

---

### 4️⃣ **Check Device Info**

* Enter the serial number
* Returns device owner, type, model, status (stolen or not)

---

### 5️⃣ **Report Stolen Device**

* Prompts for serial number
* Flags the device as stolen in the database
* Logs its current Wi-Fi SSID and timestamp

---

### 6️⃣ **Show Connected WiFi**

Displays the SSID of the currently connected Wi-Fi network.

---

### 7️⃣ **Remove Device**

* Input user type (Student/Staff)
* Provide admission number or phone number
* Lists all linked devices
* Deletes the selected one

---

### 8️⃣ **Show All Devices**

Displays all registered devices with:

* Owner name
* User type
* Device model
* Serial number
* Status (stolen or not)

## 🧹 Database Schema

```text
📍 students(id, admission_number, name, course, graduation_year, phone_number)
📍 staff(id, name, department, phone_number)
📍 registered_devices(id, serial_number, model_number, device_type, user_id, reported_stolen, user_type)
📍 device_activity_log(id, serial_number, location, ssid, timestamp)
```

---

## 💡 Ideas for Future Improvements

* Add GUI using `Tkinter` or a web interface (Flask)
* GPS-based location tracking
* Authentication system for admin login
* Export reports as PDF or CSV
